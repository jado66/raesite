There is so much pressure from our audiences to be authentic, and we are told to not be “fake” at all costs. For the most part, audiences are asking for the real deal and connecting with vulnerability. I believe that the majority of serious creators are doing their best to be authentic in the story and art that they share with the social media world.\n\n\nCreativity is Classy\n\n\nI know too many content creators and artists of social media who have been pressured to change their core message because of some nasty comments, take down a stunning image that represented hours and hours of shooting and editing to please a few haters, or abandon who they are altogether in response to the sharks of Instagram tearing them apart. Too many followers ask the impossible when issuing creators pressure and high expectations to be authentic just before tearing their latest post and hard work apart, just as the creator is striving to be genuine with their art and develop their brand authentically. \n\n\nCreativity is Artistic\n\n\nIf your influencer platform is your business, I understand that getting feedback from your customers is part of running a business… but I worry that sometimes my dear friends overextend themselves to serve customers outside their niche because those are the people screaming the loudest and complaining the most, for they are not your true audience. Serving the haters most of the time or catering to the loudest critic detracts from precious time and efforts to serve the people in your niched audience, those that you are best suited and equipped to serve and those who your natural talents are designed to uplift and bless. ...so you can cater to critics who will never be satisfied, or find the tribe and community of people who fully appreciate your branding and support your ambitions. \n\n\nCreativity is Exciting\n\n\nWhen it comes to art, I believe that you must attract people who appreciate your work for what it is, and the only way to do this is to be authentic in publishing what you perceive as good and beautiful. It’s your unique perception of beauty that makes it beautiful, and breathtakingly beautiful to your true audience, too.\n\n\nCreativity is Glamorous\n\n\nYour greatest masterpiece can only be accomplished when you stop trying to win over everyone, and start letting “you” shine so bright that people with the same eyes will see you for the first time and come running. You can try to please everyone and ultimately fail every time, or you can actually please a select group of people who will be as loyal and supportive to your mission and brand as you are. After all, most successful businesses have mastered catering to a specifically niched audience.\n\n\nCreativity is Fierce\n\n\nSo here’s the bottom line - If someone doesn’t like your work and art, it’s not for them, and you shouldn’t have to compromise who you are to please or make anyone proud but you and God. It is a lot easier and more logical for them to click unfollow than it is for you to change what it is about your art that makes it beautiful and what it is about you that makes you beautiful. So friends, let’s be kind and be ourselves here. \n\n\nCreativity is Adventurous\n\n\nThere’s room for everyone, every style, and if it’s not for you, maybe it doesn’t need to be… Maybe however there’s someone else out there that needs that post even if the only person is the creator just trying to be the most authentic and happiest version of themselves on Instagram. Maybe your unkind comment could be the reason someone who needs to hear that creator’s message goes unanswered in a time of real and pressing need. ... so if it’s not for you, move along, and the world will keep right on spinning without everything being for you. (Please excuse the sass.)\n\n\nCreativity is Elegant\n\n\nThe great thing about being you is that you are a unique combination of gifts, abilities, and talents that no one but you can bring to the table. If you don’t live to be the best version of yourself, you withhold that one-of-a-kind goodness from the world, and I for one don’t want to miss out!\n\n\nCreativity is Professional\n\n\nWhen you take a chance on yourself, you find an audience full of people who have been waiting to meet the real you all along. Be YOUuniquely you, my dear, and not only will everything turn out just fine, but you will find the greatest joy and fulfillment in the most divinely authentic version of who you were meant to be. \n\n\nXOXO With Love,\n\n\nLaRae\n\n\nCreativity is DIVERSE - There are more words to describe creativity than could fit in a whole dictionary! What words do you use to describe your creative style?\nPhoto Credit: Kurt Welker\n\n\nA special thank you to Kurt Welker for all the photography in this blog post!
