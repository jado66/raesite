People of all backgrounds, genders, colors, faiths, ethnicities, sexual orientations, occupations, religions, ages, passions, and perspectives. ...and when we all bring our unique life experiences and solutions to the polls, we use the gift of democracy to give the power to the people of this incredible country. Voting truly unites our diverse population because at the end of the day, WE are all Americans.\n\n\nI am grateful for the opportunity I have to vote and the privilege we all have to live in a democratic republic that gives us a voice through our votes. I strongly believe America was founded upon a divinely inspired constitution, and that it is essential to our nation’s survival that we do not take our sacred freedoms for granted. While living outside the country for a couple years in addition to traveling internationally the past 5 years, I felt my eyes were opened to many of the liberties we are so fortunate to have in this nation, many of which I had taken for granted while growing up in the United States. I think it is important to understand that we can still progressively move forward while appreciating what we are so blessed to have today as proud Americans. We as Americans have come a long way and still have a long way to go! \n\n\nIn this post, I’m sharing some helpful tips for voting wisely & living with the diverse perspectives of democracy. \n\n\nLiving with the Diverse Perspectives of Democracy:\n\n\nWe’ve all seen the following debate circulating social media: I can still be your friend if you think differently than me vs. I cannot be friends with a person who is immoral in their treatment of others. I believe the underlying misunderstanding is this: \n\n\nThere is a difference between disagreeing on an issue and a solution.\n\n\nFor the purpose of this post, when I say issue I am referring in a general sense to things like freedom, equality, justice, life, our rights and the rights of others, and the pursuit of happiness and the American dream. I understand that there is still much to debate on what are defined as rights vs. wants and opportunities vs. results, but most people I have met can agree that all Americans deserve the same opportunity to all of the above listed.\n\n\nIt can be true that a real friend does not blatantly disregard their friends’ rights to equality, and it can be true that we can respect an educated person who believes the solutions they support best achieve equality for all. There of course are people who disagree on the issue altogether, but for the most part, people I’ve met disagree on the solutions more than the issues.\n\n\nMost Americans value freedom, equality, justice, life, our rights and the rights of others, and the pursuit of happiness and the American Dream.\n\n\nAs long as you’re not allowing yourself to be ignorantly uneducated, and you sincerely intend to vote for the solutions you honestly believe contribute to all of the above, you have a right to vote according to the facts and your own conscience.\n\n\n...And have good reason to vote for unpopular solutions to society’s problems when specific ideologies and policies have shown a history of failure, backed with research and data. For example, as a woman, I have often felt targeted as an easy vote by many who claim to represent me, when the the historical track record of specific policies and facts say otherwise. The reality is facts don’t care about our feelings, and we oftentimes have to see past emotional arguments to factually evaluate what solutions are best for us and others. Popular solutions and successful solutions are not always synonymous.\n\n\nConcrete results from opportunities that establish national equality, justice, protecting rights for all, the sanctity of life, and freedom to pursue the American dream are far more important than the label on the party platform.\n\n\nTips for Voting Effectively: \n\n\nResearch Results of political Ideologies/Policies/Systems vs. Blindly Trusting the Label - “All that glitters is not gold.” Socialism is a prime example of this - although it is an attractive option, it is passive to ignore its historical destruction. We don’t need to experiment with some policies to know the end of the story because history has already done that for us.\n\nPolicies over Personalities - This is not to say that the characters of our leaders is irrelevant, but it is the policies and actions presidents take that have the greatest impact on our country. \n\nCandidate’s Record of Keeping Campaign Promises & Yielding Intended Results - Saying the “right” things and having the “right” platform will accomplish nothing without effective action. You can say all the right things and not do the right things, ultimately accomplishing no meaningful change. I for one want a president who walks the walk vs. just talking the talk.\n\n\nI’m voting because I value FREEDOM, equality, justice, the American dream with no ceiling for our successes but the sky, life at all stages, our divinely inspired constitutional anchor, amendment rights to defend and protect ourselves and families, America’s past and potential to stand for the rights of women and minorities, our precious children and victims of trafficking who have no voice but ours, and our vital first amendment rights to free speech and open discussions ultimately leading to successful national solutions. \n\n\nWhy are you voting?",
