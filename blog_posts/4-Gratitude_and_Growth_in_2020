These photos represent the warrior and fighter in each of us.\n\n\nWhoever you are, know you’re not alone - there’s over 7 billion people on this earth in 2020, and we’re all in this together.\n\n\n...and you can do this.\n\n\n2020 has taught me to think outside the box, find innovative solutions, and flexibly evolve in a way I never knew I could.\n\n\nThere’s a trending tweet in which someone asks “What have you accomplished this year?” and gets roasted with a response like, “Honestly, this is not the year for these kinds of questions... merely surviving this year is an accomplishment.” I could not disagree more with the first part of the response, but I wholeheartedly agree with the second part of this response. The problem isn’t the question but our perspective of an accomplishment.\n\n\nRead on, because you deserve to recognize your 2020 wins and accomplishments, I guarantee you have them. \n\n\nFirst, you’re still here to read this post, so we can check off that you survived an absolutely horrific time in history.\n\n\nSecond, are your kids still running around the house screaming like banshees? Is your spouse, significant other, or roommate still alive? Congratulations, you didn’t kill your family or loved ones during quarantine! In all seriousness though, you’ve contributed to a life and a home that has been able to sustain them and you through this time. \n\n\nThird, what is something in your life that has failed this year, or some way in which you feel you have failed? Perhaps a business or a job, or an aspiration or dream? A wise man once said, “We learn from failure, not from success.” Congratulations, you have an opportunity to learn something you couldn’t have without that failure, something that could propel you forward to even greater heights! J.K Rowling said, “Failure is so important. We speak about success all the time. But it is the ability to resist or use failure that often leads to greater success.” If even J.K Rowling’s failures lead to fame and fortune, you can count your failures as a gain for what you can accomplish with them. \n\n\nThis is absolutely a year for asking ourselves how we have grown stronger in the face of challenges and choosing to witness that growth, however great or small.\n\n\nI had travel dreams and plans I was devastated to not be able to pursue this year, but instead of sitting down and crying about it ‘’til December... I only whined about it ‘til May. 😂 Jokes aside, I found a new dream to build, one perfectly fitting for this season, that has brought me awareness of a talent and joy I never would have found otherwise.\n\n\nInstead of asking, “Why this, why me?,” perhaps a more fruitful question would be, “What am I meant to learn from this?” I promise there will be an answer if you choose to see it. The harder it’s been, the more there is to learn. Trust that God wouldn’t put you through this for nothing. \n\n\nWhat would your future self say?\n\n\nHey You,\n\n\n⚔️ You’re not just a survivor, you’re a WARRIOR. Don’t use 2020 as an excuse to sell yourself short! ⚔️ \n\n\n🧨 Rather than seeing 2020 as an excuse to throw in the towel, I choose to see 2020 as the year that really filtered out the quitters from the hustlers. Which one are you? 🧨\n\n\n🪓 Even in the midst of all the roadblocks 2020 has thrown at you, the biggest obstacle between you and your dreams is still you. Will you give up, or will you have the grit to keep going until you reach the top? 🪓\n\n\n💪 Get back up, and be a fighter! Your future self will thank you. 💪\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\nYour Future Self\n\n\nYou’re a warrior. A fighter. And this year is leaving you stronger than ever before. Bring it on.",
